# GOAT ![Godot v4.3](https://img.shields.io/badge/godot-v4.3-%23478cbf)

**Godot Open Adventure Template (GOAT)** is a tool for making 3D adventure
games. It supports a simple inventory system, interacting with objects and screens,
playing voice recordings with subtitles, and changing game settings.

Full documentation is available on [readthedocs](https://miskatonicstudio-goat.readthedocs.io). To install GOAT, please follow [these instructions](./installation/README.md).

> :warning: **Attention**: GOAT is going through a lot of changes right now. It recently moved to Godot 4, and it became a plugin. Because of that, the documentation might be a bit outdated.

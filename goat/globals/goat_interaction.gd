"""
Handles interactive objects logic. Objects in front of the player and in range
are selected. A selected object can be activated. A point at which the
interaction takes place is also stored and sent with proper signals. That
information is not relevant to e.g. a light switch, but can be used for 3D
interactive screens.

Moreover, objects can be assigned to a category. Each category can hold only
one currently selected object.
